# Claude.md – How I Used AI During Development

## 🧠 Why I Used AI

Throughout this project, I used **Cursor IDE**, which has **Claude AI** and other models integrated, to help me code smarter and faster. Instead of relying on AI for everything, I used it as a supportive tool — like a second brain — especially when I was stuck, cleaning things up, or trying to write types quickly.

## 🧹 Code Cleanup & Simplification

One of the first things Claude helped with was reducing unnecessary lines of code. With its suggestions, I was able to:

- Refactor and simplify my logic
- Remove repeated patterns
- Clean up about **200 lines** in some files

It didn’t just make things shorter — it made them more readable and easier to work with.

## 🛠 Fixing Type Errors

TypeScript can be helpful but also annoying when the types get too messy. I used Claude to:

- Identify and fix type errors
- Explain some confusing TS errors in plain English
- Suggest better typings based on actual usage

---

## ✨ Generating Types Automatically

I really liked how Cursor could generate types just by looking at how constants or props were used. It helped me:

- Create clean, accurate interfaces for my components
- Avoid repeating myself when defining similar types
- Use utility types like `Partial<>`, `Pick<>`, or `Record<>` where needed

## 📝 Comments & Docs

I also let AI help with writing some comments and explaining what certain functions were doing. It’s not perfect, but it gave me a good starting point for documenting things without spending too much time on it. (such as this document)

## 💬 Final Thoughts

It is my first time working with tRPC and Supabase, so AI helped me understand more about it and how it works behind the scenes
